I created a sample project on learning in artificial intelligence using the matplotlib and random libraries. The project is very simple and emphasizes the importance of the number of steps in AI. For example, the more data is available for learning, the closer the output values are to the actual values. In the code, there is only a dartboard and a circle drawn inside it, and we don't know the diameter of this circle. Based on the value given in the for loop, the closest value to the circle's diameter is provided. This way, the importance of the number of steps is highlighted.
